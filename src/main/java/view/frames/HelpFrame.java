    //Welcome to the Indigo Kanban board app.
//Use the editor panel on the right to add columns and cards to your board. You can also remove any component you'd like,
//        or clear the whole board.
//If you wish to modify some information you entered earlier, you can use the buttons at the bottom of each column to either
//edit its title and role, or clear all of its cards. Once you add a card to a column, clicking on it will allow you to
//view its description, and edit it. To do so, change any information directly on the card, then click 'save changes'.
//To exit the application, use the 'Exit application' button at the bottom of the editor panel.
